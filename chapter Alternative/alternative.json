Eric learns Bern claims to be from somewhere called Arctica, but does not pursue the topic further aside from mentioning the word “Antarctica”\n- The two gawk at non-human animals. Eric is incredibly passionate about most of them, though is slightly upset that Bern seems much more intrigued by the decorative foliage set up in the enclosures.\n- Internally, Bern compares Eric Zeety to Eric Dextrum and decides that, precluding any future betrayal, he likes the former more\n- Bernard Zie stares at a globe in incredible confusion\n\nSo on and so forth. It’s only tangentially relevant to the mystery or main topic.","author":{"id":"467138432037289984","name":"scipe","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"NP","color":"#FFFFFF","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"958615987131924550","name":"Overseer","color":"#FFFFFF","position":9}],"avatarUrl":"ASSETS forma de json\\76f49d11f9160bac20c987b4dbc5c23a-F34F2.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]},{"id":"1102261822469439500","type":"Default","timestamp":"2023-04-30T11:54:57.511-04:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"The day reaches its end.\n\n“…Yeah, that is pretty funny.” Bern concedes to the joke, having had it properly explained.","author":{"id":"467138432037289984","name":"scipe","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"NP","color":"#FFFFFF","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"958615987131924550","name":"Overseer","color":"#FFFFFF","position":9}],"avatarUrl":"ASSETS forma de json\\76f49d11f9160bac20c987b4dbc5c23a-F34F2.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]},{"id":"1102262066422763540","type":"Default","timestamp":"2023-04-30T11:55:55.674-04:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"“Thanks.

It's probably more efficient to put them in words that aren't the ones he has himself.\n\nThe thing about Bernard Zie is that he has an incoherent perception of both himself and his comrade Horatius, and the contradictory aspects move in lockstep. He alternatively thinks of himself as needing to live up to a masculine ideal of strength while also putting active effort into feminizing the way he presents himself. And similarly, he believes Horatius is actually a girl, presumably due to some vague hunch or default heteronormativity relating to the attention they attract from a mutual male friend, while also implicitly perceiving them as male by default.\n\nBern isn't actually unaware that gay people exist, obviously. At this point, having someone in this story who is would be the biggest contrivance of all. But he still frames relationships in some bizarre structure of power, the same way many on Earth society do. See the prototypical concepts of a \"top\" and a \"bottom\". This means that it is difficult for him to conceive of entering a romantic arrangement with Horatius Kyodu when he so frequently is implicitly coding both of them as male in his mind.","author":{"id":"467138432037289984","name":"scipe","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"NP","color":"#FFFFFF","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"958615987131924550","name":"Overseer","color":"#FFFFFF","position":9}],"avatarUrl":"ASSETS forma de json\\76f49d11f9160bac20c987b4dbc5c23a-F34F2.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]},{"id":"1197628567312420927","type":"Default","timestamp":"2024-01-18T14:48:21.31-05:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"That's the 'joke'.","author":{"id":"467138432037289984","name":"scipe","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"NP","color":"#FFFFFF","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"958615987131924550","name":"Overseer","color":"#FFFFFF","position":9}],"avatarUrl":"ASSETS forma de json\\76f49d11f9160bac20c987b4dbc5c23a-F34F2.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]},{"id":"1197629173439680634","type":"Default","timestamp":"2024-01-18T14:50:45.822-05:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"He sort of comes to recognize this, though, after a lengthy bit of scattered self-absorbed mental argument.
