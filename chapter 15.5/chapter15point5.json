A place to die. A place where you can’t die. A gateway.\n\nLet’s go with the last one, sure. Two doors are situated on opposite sides of a large circular platform that you have woken up in the center of. They have subtly different styles of construction compared to one another.\n\nThe platform is suspended in a pitch black abyss. But it’s actually quite lit up. Something like stars litter the space, softly illuminating everything and providing a vague feeling of warmth. Blue threads weave through the air, circling around the centralized platform. They seem somewhere in between physical and intangible; a compromise between a ribbon and the Aurora.\n\nMore than anything else, this is a location that provides you with a sense of calm. It is never exactly pleasant to find yourself unexpectedly awakening in an unfamiliar location, but you’ve had plenty of experience with that, for better or worse. And if it has to happen… this right now is one of the better places.\n\nIt’s nice.",

I won't bother elaborating on who, because no one should care, much less Horatius. \n\"The point is that I understand.
